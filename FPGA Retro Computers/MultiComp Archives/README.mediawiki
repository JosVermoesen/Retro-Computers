* These files are the builds we have done of Grant Searle's [http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html Multicomp] Retro-Computer.
* We down-selected some of [http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html Grant Searle's Multicomp designs] and placed our checked our [https://github.com/douggilliland/Retro-Computers/tree/master/FPGA%20Retro%20Computers/MultiComp%20Archives FPGA archives here]
* Grant's projects are attempts to create 1970's and 1980's vintage computers using recent (or relatively recent) FPGA cards.
* The [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=RetroComputing RetroComputing Wiki page] for these projects is here].
* All this code uses our [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=EP2C5-DB EP2C5-DB FPGA Retro-Computer Daughter card].

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
