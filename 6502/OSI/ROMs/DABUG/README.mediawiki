= Ohio Scientific DABUG Monitor ROM =

Author: DAVID ANEAR 2/2/81

Many parts of it are unchanged from a standard OSI SYN600 system ROM, it has the same keyboard poller, floppy disk loader, and nearly unchanged 65V monitor, but it includes some hooks that took me a while to figure out.

One thing it does is patch the keyboard input location to look for CTRL + Left-Shift key presses. When found, it loops continuously, effectively pausing execution of BASIC programs. In other words you can freeze a BASIC program by holding CTRL+LShift

Eventually I discovered the DABUG editor hooks itself into BASIC-IN-ROM when you press CTRL+Q. At this point it shows a double "^" character on the bottom row of the screen indicating it has been activated. (I don't think it's available for disk based systems since they don't use ROM based routines).

Once DABUG is active, the following commands are available:
 CTRL+U Start screen editor mode and move cursor up one line
 CTRL+D Move cursor down
 CTRL+> Move cursor right
 CTRL+< Move cursor left
 CTRL+A Copy character at cursor to input line buffer (& bottom row of screen) and move right
 CTRL+B Toggle 48x16 mode on OSI600D (& patch screen printer)
 RUB-OUT backspace/full screen clear
 SHIFT+O true backspace

There may be more features left to uncover!
