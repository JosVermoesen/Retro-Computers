PEEK(65) 
PEEK(65) is particularly interesting because it spans from the beginning of 1980 through 1987, and you can see the plight of OSI users unfold, and yet the optimism and resourcefulness of the die-hard OSI users really comes through.  Also, see the article "A History of MICRO Magazine" in the May 1985 for an interesting retrospective that is a microcosm of the era seen through the eyes of an OSI'er.   

Enjoy!
