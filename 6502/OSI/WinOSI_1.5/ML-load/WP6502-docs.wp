p#C27G#*#P#C14THE WP-6502 WORD PROCESSOR#C20The WP-6502 word processor has several built in functions to make this a really great program. They are as follows :#C35Sx where x is of the form (1)This sets the number of line feeds between the lines of text.#C35F This tells the program to finish the page its currently printing and start a new one.#C35P This does a line feed and then indents the next line 5 spaces for a paragraph.#C35Tx where x is of the form (04)This TABS x spaces from the begining of the line (not the margin).#C35Dx where x is of the form (01)This works the same as a TAB but prints "." instead of spaces.#C35Cx where x is of the form (27)This sends the ASCII character of the decimal number; Useful for sending control codes to the printer.#C35Mx where x is of the form (01)This sets a permanent left margin x spaces from the edge of the page.#C35K This stops the printing and puts you in an insert mode there by letting you type whatever you want. It is printed when you hit <RETURN>. This is useful for form letters where you would want to type in each persons name, and not want to re-type the line for each name.#C35Bx where x is of the form (01)This is used to signal the program to substitute the pre defined block of text for the control code.#C35(char) Any characters other than the ones above will be printed out across the entire width of the page from position zero to the right margin. #P#C14       <> COMMANDS <>#C20#PThe LINE EDIT mode is entered from the main menu or by hitting <RETURN> in the text entry mode. In the line edit mode you have several options which allow you to edit. They are :I -INSERT this allows you to enter text into the middle of an existing sentence. You simply space out to the place you want to insert and hit <I>. It is exited by <RETURN>.R -REPLACE this allows you to type in changes in an existing line. It is exited by <RETURN>.D -DELETE this deletes the character at the cursor.S -Line Delete this deletes the entire line shown on the screen.T -TYPE returns you to text entry mode.<RETURN> exits back to main menu. <RUB OUT> shows previous line of text.<LINE FEED> shows next line of text.#PThe GLOBAL SEARCH is entered from the main menu. This allows you to exchange one word or words for another, throughout the entire text. Simply type in the word you are looking to change, after the prompt, and then the change, after the next prompt. The program then searches the text for the word, printing out any line in which it occurs. You respond with either Y or N if you want it substituted or not.#PThe ZAP command deletes all text! So be careful!#PYou are also able to Read text off the cassette or Write data to the cassette. This is how you save your text for a future time.#PThe VEIW command preforms a dual function. When it says Pr?, it is asking if you want to print it on a printer. If you respond with anything other than Y it will only list to the screen in the configuration it was last set for. When responding Y it will ask you to enter a number of parameters, if you hit <RETURN> it will use the preset value. Lm is left margin, Li is the number of lines to a page, Wi is the width of the printed page, P#C35 is the number of the first page, #C35C is the number of copies printed. There are two more entries, AP? and Ho?. Ho returns you to the main menu and AP is something weird.#PThe Block View command displays the predefined blocks of text. These are placed anywhere in the program (usually the end). To enter a block of text hit <CTRL> <B> when in the text entry mode. The blocks of text are substituted for the #C35Bx (x is the index number for that block i.e. x=01) when encountered in a line.#PThe MOVE command is not currently understood by the writer of this.#*@
