Functional Description

The G65SC802 offers the design engineer the opportunity to utilize both
existing software programs and hardware configurations, while also
achieving the added advantages of increased register lengths and faster
execution times. The G65SC802's "ease of use" design and implementation
features provide the designer with increased flexibility and reduced
implementation costs In the Emulation mode, the G65SC802 not only offers
software compatibility, but is also hardware (pin-to-pin) compatible with
6502 designs plus it provides the advantages of 16-bit internal operation
in 6502-compatible applications. The G65SC802 is an excellent direct
replacement microprocessor for 6502 designs.

The G65SC816 provides the design engineer with upward mobility and software
compatibility in applications where a 16-bit system configuration is desired.
The G65SC816's 16-bit hardware configuration, coupled with current software
allows a wide selection of system applications. In the Emulation mode, the
G65SC816 ofters many advantages, including full software compatibility with
6502 coding. In addition, the G65SC816's powerful instruction set and
addressing modes make it an excellent choice for new 16-bit designs.

Internal organization of the G65SC802 and G65SC816 can be divided into two
parts: 1) The Register Section, and 2) The Control Section Instructions
(or opcodes) obtained from program memory are executed by implementing a
series of data transfers within the Register Section.
Signals that cause data transfers to be executed are generated within the
Control Section. Both the G65SC802 and the G65SC816 have a 16-bit internal
architecture with an 8-bit external data bus.


Instructlon Register and Decode

An opcode enters the processor on the Data Bus, and is latched into the
Instruction Register during the instruction fetch cycle. This instruction is
then decoded, along with timing and interrupt signals, to generate the
various Instruction Register control signals.


Timing Control Unit (TCU)

The Timing Control Unit keeps track of each instruction cycle as it is
executed. The TCU is set to zero each time an instruction fetch is executed,
and is advanced at the beginning of each cycle for as many cycles as is
required to complete the instruction Each data transfer between registers
depends upon decoding the contents of both the Instruction Register and
the Timing Control Unit.


Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)

All arithmetic and logic operations take place within the 16-bit ALU. In
addition to data operations, the ALU also calculates the effective address
for relative and indexed addressing modes. The result of a data operation
is stored in either memory or an internal register. Carry, Negative, Over-
flow and Zero flags may be updated following the ALU data operation.


Internal Registers (Refer to Figure 2, Programming Model)

Accumulator (A)
The Accumulator is a general purpose register which stores one of the
operands, or the result of most arithmetic and logical operations. In the
Native mode (E=0), when the Accumulator Select Bit (M) equals zero, the
Accumulator is established as 16 bits wide. When the Accumulator Select
Bit (M) equals one, the Accumulator is 8 bits wide. In this case, the upper
8 bits (AH) may be used for temporary storage in conjunction with the
Exchange AH and AL instruction.

Data Bank (DB)
During the Native mode (E=0), the 8-bit Data Bank Register holds the default
bank address for memory transfers. The 24-bit address is composed of the
16-bit instruction effective address and the 8-bit Data Bank address. The
register value is multiplexed with the data value and is present on the
Data/Address lines during the first half of a data transfer memory cycle for
the G65SC816. The Data Bank Register is initialized to zero during Reset.

Direct (D)
The 16-bit Direct Register provides an address offset for all instructions
using direct addressing. The effective bank zero address is formed by adding
the 8-bit instruction operand address to the Direct Register. The Direct
Register is initialized to zero during Reset.

Index (X and Y)
There are two Index Registers (X and Y) which may be used as general purpose
registers or to provide an index value for calculation of the effective
address. When executing an instruction with indexed addressing, the
microprocessor fetches the opcode and the base address, and then modifies the
address by adding the Index Register contents to the address prior to
performing the desired operation.
Pre-indexing or postindexing of Indirect addresses may be selected. In the
Native mode (E=0), both Index Registers are 16 bits wide (providing the Index
Select Bit (X) equals zero). If the Index Select Bit (X) equals one, both
registers will be 8 bits wide.

Processor Status (P)
The 8-bit Processor Status Register contains status flags and mode select bits.
The Carry (C), Negative (N). Overflow (V), and Zero (Z) status flags serve to
report the status ot most ALU operations. These status flags are tested by use
of Conditional Branch instructions. The Decimal (D), IRQ Disable (I), Memory,
Accumuiator (M), and Index (X) bits are used as mode select flags. These flags
are set by the program to change microprocessor operations.

The Emulation (E) select and the Break (B) flags are accessible only through
the Processor Status Register. The Emulation mode select flag is selected by
the Exchange Carry and Emulation Bits (XCE) instruction.
Table 2, G65SC802 and G65SC816 Mode Comparison, illustrates the features of
the Native (E=0) and Emulation (E=1) modes. The M and X flags are always equal
to one in the Emulation mode. When an interrupt occurs during the Emulation
mode, the Break flag is written to stack memory as bit 4 of the Processor
Status Register.

Program Bank (PB)
The 8-bit Program Bank Register holds the bank address for all instruction
fetches. The 24-bit address consists of the 16-bit instruction effective
address and the 8-bit Program Bank address. The register value is multiplexed
with the data value and presented on the Data/Address lines during the first
half of a program memory read cycle. The Program Bank Register is initialized
to zero during Reset.

Program Counter (PC)
The 16-bit Program Counter Register provides the addresses which are used to
step the microprocessor through sequential program instructions. The register
is incremented each time an instruction or operand is fetched from program
memory.

Stack Pointer (S)
The Stack Pointer is a 16-bit register which is used to indicate the next
available location in the stack memory area. It serves as the effective address
in stack addressing modes as well as subroutine and interrupt processing. The
Stack Pointer allows simple implementation of nested subroutines and multiple-
level interrupts. During the Emulation mode, the Stack Pointer high-order byte
(SH) is always equal to 01. The Bank Address is 00 for all Stack operations.


Signal Description

The following Signal Description applies to both the G65SC802 and the
SSC816 except as otherwise noted.


Abort (/ABORT) -- G65SC816
The Abort input prevents modification of any internal registers during
execution of the current instruction. Upon completion of this instruction,
an interrupt sequence is initiated. The location of the aborted opcode is
stored as the return address in Stack memory. The Abort vector address is
00FFF8, 9 (Emulation mode) or 00FFE8, 9 (Native mode). Abort is asserted
whenever there is a low level on the Abort input. and the Phi2 clock is high.
The Abort internal latch is cleared during the second cycle of the interrupt
sequence. This signal may be used to handle out-of-bounds memory references
in virtual memory systems.

Address Bus (A0-A15)
These sixteen output lines form the Address Bus for memory and I/O exchange on
the Data Bus. When using the G65SC816, the address lines may be set to the
high impedance state by the Bus Enable (BE) signal.

Bus Enable (BE)
The Bus Enable input signal allows external control of the Address and Data
Buffers, as well as the R/W signal With Bus Enable high, the R/W and Address
Buffers are active. The Data/Address Buffers are active during the first half
of every cycle and the second half of a write cycle. When BE is low, these
buffers are disabled. Bus Enable is an asynchronous signal.

Data Bus (D0-D7) -- G65SC802
The eight Data Bus lines provide an 8-bit bidirectional Data Bus for use
during data exchanges between the microprocessor and external memory or
peripherals. Two memory cycles are required for the transfer of 16-bit values.

Data/Address Bus (D0/BA0-D7/BA7) -- G65SC816
These eight lines multiplex bits BAO-BA7 with the data value. The Bank Address
is present during the first half of a memory cycle, and the data value is read
or written during the second half of the memory cycle.
The Bank address external transparent latch should be latched when the Phi2
clock is high or RDY is low. Two memory cycles are required to transfer 16-bit
values. These lines may be set to the high impedance state by the Bus Enable
(BE) signal.

Emulation Status (E) -- G65SC816 (Also Applies to G65SC802, 44-Pin Version)
The Emulation Status output reflects the state of the Emulation (E) mode flag
in the Processor Status (P) Register. This signal may be thought of an opcode
extension and used for memory and system management.

Interrupt Request (/IRQ)
The Interrupt Request input signal is used to request that an interrupt
sequence be initiated. When the IRQ Disable (I) flag is cleared, a low input
logic level initiates an interrupt sequence after the current instruction is
completed. The Wait for Interrupt (WAI) instruction may be executed to ensure
the interrupt will be recognized immediately. The Interrupt Request vector
address is 00FFFE,F (Emulation mode) or 00FFEE,F (Native mode). Since IRQ is a
level-sensitive input, an interrupt will occur if the interrupt source was not
cleared since the last interrupt.
Also, no interrupt will occur if the interrupt source is cleared prior to
interrupt recognition.

Memory Lock (/ML) -- G65SC816 (Also Applies to G65SC802, 44-Pin Version)
The Memory Lock output may be used to ensure the integrity of Read-Modify-Write
instructions in a multiprocessor system. Memory Lock indicates the need to
defer arbitration of the next bus cycle. Memory Lock is low during the last
three or five cycles of ASL, DEC, INC, LSR, ROL, ROR, TRB, and TSB memory
referencing instructions, depending the state of the M flag.

Memory/Index Select Status (M/X) -- G65SC816
This multiplexed output reflects the state ot the Accumulator (M) and index (X)
select flags (bits 5 and 4 of the Processor Status (P) Register).
Flag M is valid during the Phi2 clock positive transition. Instructions PLP,
REP, RTI and SEP may change the state of these bits. Note that the M/X output
may be invalid in the cycle following a change in the M or X bits. These bits
may be thought of as opcode extensions and may be used for memory and system
management.

Non-Maskable Interrupt (/NMI)
A high-to-low transition initiates an intenupt sequence after the current
instruction is completed. The Wait for Interrupt (WAI) instruction may be
executed to ensure that the interrupt will be recognized immediately. The
Non-Maskable Interrupt vector address is 00FFFA,B (Emulation mode) or 00FFEA,B
(Native mode). Since NMI is an edge-sensitive Input, an interrupt will occur
if there is a negative transition while servicing a previous interrupt. Also,
no interrupt will occur if NMI remains low.

Phase 1 Out (Phi1 (OUT)) -- G65SC802
This inverted clock output signal provides timing for external read and write
operations. Executing the Stop (STP) instruction holds this clock in the low
state.

Phase 2 In (Phi2 (IN))
This is the system clock input to the microprocessor internal clock generator
(equivalent to Phi0 (IN) on the 6502). During the low power Standby Mode, Phi2
(IN) should be held in the high state to preserve the contents of internal
registers.

Phase 2 Out (Phi2 (OUT)) -- G65SC802
This clock output signal provides timing for external read and write
operations. Addresses are valid (after the Address Setup Time (TADS))
following the negative transition of Phase 2 Out. Executing the Stop (STP)
instruction holds Phase 2 Out in the High state.

Read/Write (R/W)
When the R/W output signal is in the high state, the microprocessor is reading
data from memory or I/O. When in the low state, the Data Bus contains valid
data from the microprocessor which is to be stored at the addressed memory
location. When using the G65SC816, the R/W signal may be set to the high
impedance state by Bus Enable (BE).

Ready (RDY)
This bidirectional signal indicates that a Wait for Interrupt (WAI) instruction
has been executed allowing the user to halt operation of the microprocessor.
A low input logic level will halt the microprocessor in its current state (note
that when in the Emulation mode, the G65SC802 stops only during a read cycle).
Returning RDY to the active high state allows the microprocessor to continue
following the next Phase 2 In Clock negative transition. The RDY signal is
internally pulled low following the execution of a Wait for Interrupt (WAI)
instruction, and then returned to the high state when a /RES, /ABORT, /NMI, or
/IRQ external interrupt is provided. This feature may be used to eliminate
interrupt latency by placing the WAI instruction at the beginning of the IRQ
servicing routine. If the IRQ Disable flag has been set, the next instruction
will be executed when the IRQ occurs. The processor will not stop after a WAI
instruction if RDY has been forced to a high state. The Stop (STP) instruction
has no effect on RDY.

Reset (/RES)
The Reset input is used to initialize the microprocessor and start program
execution. The Reset input buffer has hysteresis such that a simple R-C timing
circuit may be used with the internal pullup device. The /RES signal must be
held low for at least two clock cycles after VDD reaches operating voltage.
Ready (RDY) has no effect while RES is being held low. During this Reset
conditioning period, the following processor initialization takes place:

		   Registers

	   D  = 0000		SH = 01
	   DB = 00		XH = 00
	   PB = 00		YH = 00

		  N V M X D I Z C/E
	   P =  * * 1 1 0 1 * */1

		* = Not Initialized
		STP and WAI instructions are cleared.


	              Signals

	   E    = 1		VDA = 0
	   M/X  = 1		/VP = 1
	   R/W  = 1		VPA = 0
	   SYNC = 0


When Reset is brought high, an interrupt sequence is initiated:
* R/W remains in the high state during the stack address cycles.
* The Reset vector address is 00FFFC,D.


Set Overtlow (/SO) -- G65SC802
A negative transition on this input sets the Overflow (V) flag, bit 6 of the
Processor Status (P) Register.

Synchronlze (SYNC) -- G65SC802
The SYNC output is provided to identify those cycles during which the
microprocessor is fetching an opcode. The SYNC signal is high during an opcode
fetch cycle, and when combined with Ready (RDY), can be used for single
instruction execution.


Valid Data Address (VDA) and
Valid Program Address (VPA) -- G65SC816
These two output signals indicate the type of memory being accessed by
the address bus. The following coding applies:

VDA VPA
 0   0	Internal Operation -- Address and Data Bus available. Address
	outputs may be invalid due to low byte additions only.

 0   1	Valid program address -- may be used for program cache control.

 1   0	Valid data address -- may be used for data cache control.

 1   1	Opcode fetch -- may be used for program cache control
	and single step control.


VDD and Vss
VDD Vss the positive supply voltage and Vss is system ground. When
using only one ground on the G65SC802 DIP package, pin 21 preferred.

Vector Pull (VP) -- G65SC816 (Also Applies to G65SC802 44-Pin Version)
The Vector Pull output indicates that a vector location is being addressed
during an interrupt sequence. /VP is low during the last two interrupt sequence
cycles, during which time the processor reads the interrupt vector. The /VP
signal may be used to select and prioritize interrupts from several sources by
modifying the vector addresses.
