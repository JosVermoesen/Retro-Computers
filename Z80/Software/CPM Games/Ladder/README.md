# Ladder

Ladder was originally written for the CP/M operating system and the game came bundled with Kaypro computers. It is copyrighted by:

For information on the game, see: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_(video_game))

This version is adapted to VT100 ANSI escape sequences.

## Note

It seems to me that ``LADCONF.COM`` uses some kind of "wrong" VT100 sequences, as my terminal does not like them - the output looks wrong.

This ``LADDER.DAT`` has been changed slightly by Marco Maccaferri to make it work with my RC2014 VGA VT100 terminal.

So don't change it using ``LADCONF.COM`` :)
