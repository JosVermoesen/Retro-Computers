This is version 2.2 of wanderer. I've jumped the version numbers out
of my original sequence so that they now match the same version numbers
as used by Steven Shipway.

You will need WANDERER.LBR to be able to fully use this, however the
version of WANDERER in this .LBR is the one to use - it has a couple
of bug fixes: the old version can't solve screen 31, and can't get
the monster on screen 37. Basically, all you need from the earlier
one are the screens, replace any other files with those from this
.LBR. Also replace SCREEN.050 from the old one, as this was a special
"end marker" screen, that job has now been taken over by SCREEN.061

Happy wandering :-)
