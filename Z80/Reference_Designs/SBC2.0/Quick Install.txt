Build the board. This is quite straightforward, but note the following:
The wide chips are to be mounted using "turned" sockets. First solder in the parts that go under these chips, then fit the sockets. You might need to cut away some of the "struts" within the sockets. Alternatively use socket strips, cut to length.

Upload SMON35.HEX to your ROM chip

Copy image System18.img to your SD/CF-card. Use direct imaging software (dd in Linux, Win32DiskImager in Windows). Copy to the start of the card. 

Insert card in your interface board, connect the interface board to the system board, connect power to your system board and to your interface board.

Use a 512 kByte SRAM chip. Most OS-es will run in less, but the he BIOS will assume at least 512 kByte to be present for the RAM-disk.
