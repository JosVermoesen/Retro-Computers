= 6800 FigForth in ROM =

* Original MultiComp design is copyright by Grant Searle 2014
** Grant Searle's web site http://searle.hostei.com/grant/
** Grant Searle's "multicomp" page at http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html
* Grant did not have a 6800 ROM.
* This build uses a figForth ROM.

Changes to this code by Doug Gilliland 2022

= Features =

* MC6800 CPU
** Runs at 25 MHz for internal SRAM and Peripherals
** Runs at 16.7 MHz for external SRAM
* ROM - running figForth from back in the day
** https://github.com/douggilliland/Retro-Computers/tree/master/6800/fig-FORTH/figFORTH_InROM
* J3 jumper selects either built-in VDU or Serial port
* VDU - ANSI terminal (default = jumper removed)
** XGA 80x25 character display
** PS/2 keyboard
* MC6850 ACIA UART
* 1MB External SRAM
* MMU1, MMU2 Memory management register control window

= Front Panel controls Internal memory =

* [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Front_Panel_for_8_Bit_Computers_V2 Wiki page]
* Monitors Address/Data when in Run mode

* PB31 - RUN - (Upper left pushbutton) - Run/Halt (Upper left LED on for Run)
* PB30 - RESET CPU
* PB29 - STEP - Not yet implemented
* PB28 - Not used
* PB27 - CLEAR - Clears address if in Set Address Mode control mode
* PB26 - INCADR - Increment address - Function depend on Enable Write Data and Set Address Mode controls
** Ignored if Set Address is selected
** If Enable Write Data is selected, Write data then Increment address
** If Enable Write Data is not selectedrwise increment read address and read next location
* PB25 - SETDAT - Enable Write Data control - Bottom row of pushbuttons controls write of data to memory
* PB24 - SETADR - Set Address Mode control - Middle two rows of pushbuttons control LEDs

= Memory Map =

* 0x0000-0x0FFF	- 4KB Internal SRAM
* 0x1000-0x2FFF	- 6KB Internal ROM
* 0x3000-0x3FFF	- 4KB Internal SRAM
* 0x4000-0x7FFF	- 16KB Internal SRAM
* 0xA000-0xBFFF	- 512KB External SRAM
** 8KB Windows, 64 frames
** MMU1 provides additional address bits
** MMU1 initialized to 0
** Set to first frame allowing memory to appear as part of Tiny BASIC contiguous space
* 0xC000-0xDFFF	- 512KB External SRAM
** 8KB Window, 64 frames
** MMU2 provides additional address bits
** MMU2 initialized to 0
** Set to first frame allowing memory to appear as part of Tiny BASIC contiguous space
* 0xE000-0xEBFF	- Deliberately left open to not conflict
* 0xFC18-0xFC19	- VDU (serSelect J3 JUMPER REMOVED)
* 0xFC28-0xFC19	- ACIA (serSelect J3 JUMPER INSTALLED)
* 0xFC30			  - MMU1 Latch 7-bits
* 0xFC31			  - MMU2 Latch 7-bits
* 0xFFFE-0xFFFF	- ROM Reset Vector
