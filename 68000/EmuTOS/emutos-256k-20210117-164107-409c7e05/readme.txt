EmuTOS - 256 KB versions

These ROMs are suitable for the following hardware:
- STe
- Mega STe
- emulators of the above

Note: Extra hardware is autodetected, but the following TT- and
Falcon-specific hardware is not supported: memory control unit,
video, SCSI, NVRAM, and the second MFP of a TT.

The desktop features are comparable to Atari TOS 2.

Each ROM contains a single language:

etos256cz.img - Czech (PAL)
etos256de.img - German (PAL)
etos256es.img - Spanish (PAL)
etos256fi.img - Finnish (PAL)
etos256fr.img - French (PAL)
etos256gr.img - Greek (PAL)
etos256hu.img - Hungarian (PAL)
etos256it.img - Italian (PAL)
etos256nl.img - Dutch (PAL)
etos256no.img - Norwegian (PAL)
etos256pl.img - Polish (PAL)
etos256ru.img - Russian (PAL)
etos256se.img - Swedish (PAL)
etos256sg.img - Swiss German (PAL)
etos256us.img - English (NTSC)
etos256uk.img - English (PAL)

The following optional files are also supplied:
emuicon.rsc - contains additional icons for the desktop
emuicon.def - definition file for the above

Notes on possible points of confusion
1. The emuicon.rsc file format differs from deskicon.rsc used by later
versions of the Atari TOS desktop.
2. Selecting Norwegian/Swedish currently sets the language to English,
but the keyboard layout to Norwegian/Swedish.
3. The 'Shutdown' menu item is active when EmuTOS is run under an
emulator supporting NatFeats (under Hatari, you need to enable this
with the "--natfeats on" option).

These ROM images have been built using:
make all256

This release has been built on Linux Mint (a Ubuntu derivative), using
Vincent Rivi√®re's GCC 4.6.4 cross-compiler.  The custom tools used in
the build process were built with native GCC 4.8.4.

The source package and other binary packages are available at:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/1.0/

The extras directory (if provided) contains:
(1) one or more alternate desktop icon sets, which you can use to replace
    the builtin ones.  You can use a standard resource editor to see what
    the replacement icons look like.
    To use a replacement set, move or rename the existing emuicon.rsc &
    emuicon.def files in the root directory, then copy the files containing
    the desired icons to the root, and rename them to emuicon.rsc/emuicon.def.
(2) a sample mouse cursor set in a resource (emucurs.rsc/emucurs.def).  This
    set is the same as the builtin ones, but you can use it as a basis to
    create your own mouse cursors.
    To use a replacement set, copy the files containing the desired mouse
    cursors to the root, and rename them to emucurs.rsc/emucurs.def.
