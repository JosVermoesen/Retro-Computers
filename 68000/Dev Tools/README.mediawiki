== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there"
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me
