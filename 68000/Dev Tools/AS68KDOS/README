            M680x0 Cross Assembler for MSDOS Systems.
            -----------------------------------------

  This is a modification to an Assembler that was written for a UNIX system, 
(see the original comments at the end of this file).  The code was changed
to be compiled under TURBOC and some extra features added.  I have included a
list of the changes that I made for this version.

  The file SPEC contains detailed information about the assembler.

  I am planning on producing a Linker to use with this assembler.  This will
make it a bit easier to produce large programs without having to assemble
everything in one large lump.

  If you have any questions, suggestions or complaints about this version
of the assembler please contact me:

        Changes to the assembler
        ------------------------

1. Converted int to long where appropriate.  The original (UNIX) version 
   assumed that an int was 32 bits long.

2. Put prototypes for all functions in as.h.  I did this mainly to
   catch any problems/ommissions with the int to long conversion.

3. Change to allow .S length field on branch instructions 
   e.g:   BNE.S    DEST

4. Change to allow immediate string values
   e.g    CMP.W     #'X=',(SP)

5. Ignore label on an IDNT pseudo op.  Previously an error was likely
   to be generated when the same label was defined later in the code.

6. Fixed code generation for DC when a length of W or L is specified
   and a string is used.  Previously 1 word/long would be generated
   for each byte in the string:
   e.g     DC.L    '12345'  should generate  3132 3334 3520 2020

7. Fixed a couple of '=' in if statements that should have been '=='.

8. Added DCB pseudo op.

9. Added listing of symbol table at end of assembly.

10.  Made XREF functional. The XREF pseudo op now causes names to be 
     inserted into symbol table. The value associated with an XREF is 
     set to a large value so as to force long addresses when referenced.



       New MAKE file for Turbo C
       -------------------------

1. A make file to suit Turbo C was created (as68k.mak & as68k.rsp).

2. Since AWK is not a standard part of DOS systems, I wrote a C
   version of the AWK program TABLE.AWK.  This program (bldtab.c) is
   used to build the module TABLE.C.


               The following is the README file that came with
                       the original UNIX version.

	Where can this package be used?

	This package was originally developed on a Sun system. As such it will
	work on Berkeley based Unix systems. It has also been ported to Apple's
	AUX environment. As a general rule, you can reasonably expect it to
	work in any Unix environment--it was designed for portability.
	No guarantees of course :-)



	Output file format. 

	This package does not include a linker/loader. The assembler generates
	S record format files. If your loader does not understand S records,
	modifications will have to be made.



	More information:

	Please refer to the spec file included with this package for more
	information about using the assembler. ENJOY!
