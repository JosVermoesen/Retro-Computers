== land-boards 68000 Retro-Computers ==

* These are our 68000 Retro-Computer files
* Builds of two platform
** [https://github.com/douggilliland/Retro-Computers/tree/master/68000/TS2_FPGA TS2] - Basic 68K CPU with character display
** [https://github.com/douggilliland/Retro-Computers/tree/master/68000/TG68_AMR AMR] - CPU with VGA frame buffer from SDRAM and other peripherals
* Hope they are as much fun for you as they are for us
* The [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=RetroComputing RetroComputing page for these projects is here]
* Some of this code was created to exercise our [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=EP2C5-DB EP2C5-DB FPGA Retro-Computer Daughter card]

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there"
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me
