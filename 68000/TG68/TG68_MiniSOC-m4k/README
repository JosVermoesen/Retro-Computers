TG68 MiniSOC - a mini System-on-Chip project built around Tobias Gubener's
TG68k processor core.

The project is designed to run on multiple platforms, and currently has toplevels for:
* the Altera DE1 board
* the Turbo Chameleon 64
* a bare-bones Cyclone III board I sourced on Ebay,
  and for which I built a custom IO board.

The code within is highly experimental and may well not build at any
given time, but I will try and remember to tag the repo at key points,
so anything that bears a tag should be buildable.
