* Some of this code was created to exercise our [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=EP2C5-DB EP2C5-DB FPGA Retro-Computer Daughter card]

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
