== w11: PDP 11/70 CPU and SoC ==

[https://github.com/wfjm/w11 Original project by Walter F.J. Mueller (wfjm)]

The project contains the VHDL code for a complete DEC PDP-11 system: a PDP-11/70 CPU with memory management unit, but without floating point unit, a complete set of mass storage peripherals (RK11/RK05, RL11/RL02, RH70/RP06, TM11/TU10) and a rather complete set of UNIBUS peripherals (DL11, LP11, PC11, DZ11, and DEUNA), and last but not least a cache and memory controllers for SRAM, PSRAM and SDRAM (via Xilinx MIG core). The design is FPGA proven, runs currently on Digilent Arty A7, Basys3, Cmod A7, Nexys A7, Nexys4, Nexys3, Nexys2 and S3board boards and boots 5th Edition UNIX and 2.11BSD UNIX.
